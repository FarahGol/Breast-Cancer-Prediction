Breast Cancer Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnoses using machine learning classifiers. Various supervised learning models are applied to classify tumor samples as malignant or benign based on extracted features.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. It was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

Classifiers Used
The following machine learning classifiers were implemented:

Logistic Regression
Na√Øve Bayes (GaussianNB)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Extra Trees
AdaBoost
XGBoost
Gradient Boosting
Voting Classifier
Stacking Classifier
Required Libraries
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost 
joblib
Python Version
The project is implemented using Python 3.11.11.
